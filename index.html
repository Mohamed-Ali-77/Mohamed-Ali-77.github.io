      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <h3>1- TINY Language Compiler</h3>
        <!-- Add a brief description of the project -->
        <p>The Tiny Compiler app is a powerful tool for compiling code written in the Tiny language. It offers a range of features, including syntax highlighting, error checking, and code completion, to help you write and debug your code more efficiently.
            To create an AST, the tool first needs to scan the code and identify the different tokens that make up the program, such as keywords, variables, and operators. It can then use this information to build a tree-like structure that represents the code's syntax and structure.</p>

      <h3>2- XML-Manager Program </h3>
        <!-- Add a brief description of the project -->
        <p>XML (Extensible Markup Language) is one of the most famous formats for storing and sharing information among different devices. Some text editors such as Sublime Text are able to parse such files and do some basic operations. In our Application, We worked on developing a GUI (Graphical User Interface) based program to parse and visualize an XML file and Do Some operation on it such (Detect and Correct Syntax Error , Compress the file , Decompress it , Format it and Convert it to JSON Format.</p>

      <h3>3- Simple Perception Stack for Self Driving Cars</h3>
        <!-- Add a brief description of the project -->
        <p>The Simple Perception Stack for Self-Driving Cars project is a fundamental building block for creating self-driving cars. By focusing on video streams from cameras, the project aims to provide a complete perception system that can accurately detect lane lines and other vehicles on the road. The project is split into two phases, with the first phase focused on lane line detection and the second phase focused on cars detection. The end result will be a system that provides a robust and reliable perception solution for self-driving cars, enabling them to make safe and informed decisions on the road.</p>
